/** @mainpage Stopwatch and Sorting Algorithms
*
* @author Peter Bauer
*
* @section intro Introduction
* In this project we will collect our work concerning sorting. Since sorting is a time critical
* operation we will measure the runtime performance of our implementations. In order to be able
* to do so, we have to implement a simple stopwatch first.
*
* Furthermore, implement two sorting algorithms, which are pretty straight forward,
* namely bubble sort and insertion sort.
*
* @section unit_tests The Unit Tests
* The functions in stopwatch.cpp and sorting_algorithms.cpp have to be implemented as they are
* specified. In
* order to facilitate this the unit tests in the files test_stopwatch.cpp and
* test_sorting_algorithms.cpp will guide you towards a correct implementation.
*
* For implementing the stopwatch check out the function clock() and the constant
* CLOCKS_PER_SEC from time.h
*
* @section game The Comparision
* Finally the sorting algorithms have to be compared. In the main function of file
* sorting_algorithms_main_driver.cpp you have to call each sorting algorithm on arrays of
* different sizes which are defined in the file sorting_algorithms_main_driver.cpp.
